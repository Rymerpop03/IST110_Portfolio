# Reflection
Lesson 8 introduced different applications and specifically focused on OSINT. Although there was no discussion post for this lesson, we did have a project to complete. My project explained two different concepts of OSINT: Web Scraping and Metadata analysis. I created a presentation in which I explained how both work and gave a quick example that I developed in visual studio code. I made sure to keep it very simple.
