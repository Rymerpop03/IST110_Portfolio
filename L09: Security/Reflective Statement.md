# Reflection
Lesson 9 introduces cybersecurity and how vital it is to protect your information in todays world. To introduce us to different cybersecurity concepts, we were taught the basics of a few different concepts and asked to create an infographic relating to that concept. I chose the subject of Honeypots. Honeypots are decoys that are disguised to look like real vulnerable systems. By researching honeypots further, I have gained lots of insight into how they function and improve security across the globe.
