# Introduction to Information Science and Technology
Hello everyone, my name is Rymer Popovich and I am an Applied Data Science major with a focus in Cybersecurity. I am from Santa Barbara, California. A few things I love to do include playing basketball, skiing, lifting, and playing video games. As a senior studying data science, I definitely have strengths in programming. I am most proficient in SQL, R, and python. Regarding my weaknesses, I would say I am least knowledgeable in the areas of hardware development. 

The IT disciple that is most relevant to me would be Information Sciences. I am constantly working with various datasets and cleaning/tidying data. A lot of the time these datasets are business related with sensitive information involved. I have also spent a good amount of time working on ERD diagrams and establishing relationships between different attributes within a database. Information Sciences relates a lot to many different analyst positions: Data Analyst, Quant Analyst, Business Analyst, Finance Analyst, etc. However, this disciple can become limited on how deep into technology those positions can actually go. A lot of them are more information and report based than technology based.
