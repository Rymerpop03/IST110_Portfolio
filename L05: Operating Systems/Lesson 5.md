# Operating Systems Discussion
Dear Visual Studio Code,

 

When I started studying computer science in high school, we first met. Throughout the years we have gone through many long nights of programming and frustration. Although, you have stuck with me along the way. Through all the downloaded libraries and code compiling, you have worked with me to solve so many complex problems. I hope that we can continue our long back-end nights of coding functions and troubleshooting errors together. 

 

With Love,

Rymer

 

Reflection Questions

I chose Visual Studio Code, because as a data science major, I am constantly writing functions in python and have spent numerous hours on VSC. 

I felt like I was truly able to express how useful this program actually is. I have been using it for so long and am so glad that it exists.

This activity shows how reliable technology has been over the years and how much we rely on its uses. 

I think through the process of writing this letter, I am able to better understand how Visual Studio has made programming in my life so much easier.
