# Reflection
This lesson discussed the three main operating systems that are used in the world of technology: Macos, Windows, and Linux. For my discussion post, I was tasked with writing a letter to a software/application that I constantly use and I decided to write about Visual Studio Code. My reasoning for VSC was because I started my educational career focusing on computer science in high school, but soon switched to data science where it would still prove to be a very useful tool. Along with the discussion post, we also performed a comparison actiity of the three operating systems. We were given scenarios and asked to select the most appropriate operating system to use.
