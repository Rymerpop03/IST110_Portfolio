Learning Curve: Out of the three languages, machine language is the hardest to learn since it is written in binary. Understanding binary and debugging can be extremely tedious and require deep knowledge. Assembly also has a very steep learning curve because it involves direct interaction with hardware. Users must understand CPU architecture and memory management in detail. Finally, High-level languages are definitely the easiest to learn due to their syntax being english-like. These languages focus on algorithms and problem-solving rather than the low-level implementation details.
