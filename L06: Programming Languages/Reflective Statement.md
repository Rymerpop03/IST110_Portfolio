# Reflection
Within lesson 6, we covered various programming languages and the concepts behind them. Generally, we looked into machine language, assembly language, and high-level language. Within my discussion post, I created a table to compare and contrast the three. For this lesson's activity, we were exposed to some python and tasked with writing a few lines of code. It was very simple but a great introduction into programming.
