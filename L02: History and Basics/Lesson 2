# Binary Statement Discussion
1. Hello

2. This is a binary code

3. I love data

This seemed to be pretty straight forward. I simply used the ASCII table to translate these binary messages. I did notice that the third message had two newline sequences at the end. Not sure if that was an accident or on purpose
