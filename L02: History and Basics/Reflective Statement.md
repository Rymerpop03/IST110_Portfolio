# Reflection
Within lesson 2, we were introduced to binary sequences. Specifically, we were taught how to use an ASCII table to translate binary into english characters. Within my discussion post, I was tasked with translating binary code which proved to be relatively simple to complete. We also had an activity called Binary Representation where I explained why binary is so important within the world of IT and gave some examples. Overall, I enjoyed this section and the activites associated with it.
