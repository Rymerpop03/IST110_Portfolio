# Database Technology and Privacy Discussion 
We are currently living in the information age. Where one of the most valuable assets is data. The biggest issue about data being so widespread is the collection of it without any knowledge. Pretty much everything we do online is either being tracked or recorded in some database. This information is being sold to companies worldwide to target advertisements towards individuals. An article that I find really interesting is written by Mithril International and talks about the company Tesla. Most people think of the cars when they hear Tesla, however, there is something that they dont realize. Tesla is not a car company, its a data company. It gathers some of the highest quantites of data out of all companies in the world and it generates a huge profit off of it.

A survey was done at the Pew Research Center and it shows that 67% of all Americans say they understand little to nothing about what companies are doing with their personal data and 73% of Americans feel they have little to no control over what can be done with their data (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/

Even those little robots that drive around in the Giant supermarkets are studying your grocery purchasing habits to target advertisements towards you. It really is ridiculout how far this exploiting of data has gone and unless people can become aware of it, it will not stop anytime soon.
