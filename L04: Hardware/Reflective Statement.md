# Reflection
Within lesson 4, we start to touch on hardware, specifically hardware within computers. For my discussion post in this lesson, I broke down the main components of a computer and explained the functions of each of them. This includes the GPU, CPU, RAM, PSU, SSD, and Motherboard. I also talked about some of the hardware innovations that are being made and how they are effecting the average person. Lastly, I performed a hardware dissection lab on a 2012 Macbook Pro and a Steam Deck by identifying the key components within each.
