# Crowdsourcing Discussion
Definition and Basics: Crowdsourcing is performed by inviting a large group of people to contribute ideas and solutions instead of relying on a single small team or organization. It is normally referred to as open calls for contributions, meaning these people might be employees, customers, or completely random participants. The idea of crowdsourcing is that a diverse group can outperform a single entity on many tasks. Individual contributions might be noisy or skewed, due to biases. With a larger group of people, you can more properly weigh the results.s

 

Types of Crowdsourcing: There are many different types of crowdsourcing such as idea competitions, microtasks, and open innovation. Idea competitions normally invited a broad group to propose concepts or solutions, often including prizes. Microtasks break larger projects down into many smaller tasks that many people can complete. This tends to be used for projects that are high-volume and repetitive. Lastly, open innovation is used for experts, startups, and researchers to solve harder and more technical problems. These problems normally required specialized knowledge in a specific field.
