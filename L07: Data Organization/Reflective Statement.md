Lesson 7 was probably my favorite lesson since I am a data science student and am constantly performing data analysis so it related very strongly to my interests. For my discussion post, I mentioned a VBA macro that you could create within microsoft excel to perform calculations based on a certain criteria and display a value based on that criteria. We performed two projects within this lesson, the first was a music genome project where we chose a music artist from pandora and answered a series of questions based on the database associated with that music. The next project was a CODIS case where we performed analysis on a crime story in which the suspect was found through a DNA analysis.
