# Data Organization Discussion
Example: One example of an Excel macro is a GPA calculator based on a students cumulative grades. 

Purpose: This macro would take into account all of a students classes and perform a calculation of the mean and convert that into a GPA format.

Components: The macros would utilize VBA code with commands like if-else statements to check whether each grade was an A, B, C, etc. It would then utilize a math function to calculate the mean of the grades. Finally, it would convert into a 4 scale GPA format. 

Pros & Cons: The pros would be that it can automatically calculate a student's GPA. However, a con would be that the macro won't work if there is incomplete data or if the format of the data changes. 

Customization: This would be a customizable macro, since you would be able to use it with pretty much anything that you want to sort into categories. You would simple remove the GPA conversion calculation and you have a simple if-else organizer.

Learning Resources: By looking through YouTube, it is very easy to learn how to write macros such as this.

Security Considerations: Make sure to only enable macros for trusted sources as otherwise it can lead to a security risk.
